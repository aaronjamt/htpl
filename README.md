# HTPL: Hyper-Text Programming Language




<sub><sub><sub><sub>HTPL does not make HTML a programming language. HTML is still a markup language and we can do nothing to change it. Terms and conditions apply. Offer valid only through the end of 32-bit Unix timestamps. We take no responsibility for any fights caused by this language. If you have a history of IPRA (irrational programming-related anger) do NOT use this.</sub></sub></sub></sub>
